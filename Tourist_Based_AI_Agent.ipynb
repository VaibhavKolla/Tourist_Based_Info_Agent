      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mFinal Answer: \n",
      "Based on the information I found on Lonely Planet's website, I have tailored some recommendations for your 3-day spiritual trip to Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh next month. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Accommodations:**\n",
      "Considering your preference for mid-range accommodations close to the Sri Venkateswara Temple, I recommend looking into Hotel Bliss. It is a popular choice for pilgrims due to its proximity to the temple and comfortable facilities, suitable for elderly travelers. You can check their availability and book in advance to secure your stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Darshan Timings:**\n",
      "The darshan timings at the Sri Venkateswara Temple in Tirumala are subject to change, so I recommend checking the official temple website closer to your travel dates for the most updated information. Typically, the temple opens early in the morning and has different darshan times throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other Important Temples to Visit:**\n",
      "Apart from the Sri Venkateswara Temple, you may also want to visit the Padmavathi Temple in Tiruchanur, dedicated to Goddess Padmavathi. This temple is significant for pilgrims and offers a serene atmosphere for spiritual experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Local Specialties:**\n",
      "When it comes to local cuisine, you must try the famous Tirupati Laddu, a sweet delicacy offered as prasad at the Sri Venkateswara Temple. Additionally, explore the local Andhra cuisine known for its spicy flavors and unique dishes like Gongura Pachadi and Pesarattu.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Traveling with Elderly Parents:**\n",
      "To ensure a comfortable pace for your elderly parents, consider arranging for a wheelchair or palanquin service at the temple complex. This will help them navigate the temple premises with ease and enjoy the darshan experience without much walking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I recommend planning your visit strategically by checking the temple's official website for darshan timings, booking accommodations in advance, and exploring the local specialties and nearby temples for a holistic spiritual experience. If you have any specific preferences or more details to share, feel free to let me know so I can further personalize your travel recommendations.
